Battle DeathStars is similar to the traditional Battleship® game, except it uses Star Wars® Death Stars and planets instead.
The program was designed by Ryan Beckett and Shreeji B. Patel.
When the game starts, the player should place planets by clicking on 10 points throughout the grid. Alternatively, the player
may instead use the place random planets button. Additionally, as an accessibility feature, the player may use spin controls
and text boxes to place planets.
The player should adjust the number of planets as well as the number of shots allowed.
The number of shots allowed is the limit on how many times the Death Star can fire before it runs out of energy.
Setup Mode: Means that the user can place planets at this time.
Test Mode: Allows the user to view where planets are placed during shooting. During test mode, only test planets are destroyed.
Battle Mode: Indicates that real planets will be destroyed when the Death Star hits one. Battle mode transitions back to Setup
mode when all of the planets have been destroyed.
The goal of this game is to shoot as many planets with the Death Star as possible while using the least amount of shots.
